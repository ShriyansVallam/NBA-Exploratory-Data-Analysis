## **Overview**
This project provides an in-depth analysis of NBA player and team trends over time, using data visualization techniques to explore various aspects of the league. As a fan of the NBA for a few years now, I aimed to uncover patterns, shifts, and insights, both from a general perspective of the NBA and focusing on specific trends of interest, such as changes in player demographics, physical attributes, and team performance metrics.

The main questions I intended to explore include:

* How has the percentage of U.S. vs. non-U.S. players changed over time?
* What trends can be observed in player height, age, and weight across different NBA eras?
* What key performance metrics stand out for the Dallas Mavericks?
* Which players can be classified as "draft busts," and what are the key factors involved?
* Which colleges have produced the most NBA players?
* Which teams have had the most first-round picks, and what impact has this had on their performance?

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project was found on Kaggle and contains detailed information about players, teams, drafts, and career statistics

## **Main Findings**

### **Origin, Height, Age**
* **Player Nationality:** The majority of NBA players continue to be from the United States, highlighting the league's strong domestic talent pool, although there is a notable increase in international players over recent years.
* **Height Trends:** There has been a gradual decrease in average player height over the years. This trend correlates with the increasing prevalence of small-ball lineups, which prioritize speed and agility, allowing teams to better utilize the three-point line and adapt to modern playing styles.
* **Age Trends:** The average age of players in the league has steadily decreased. This shift is largely attributed to more athletes opting to enter the NBA directly from high school or early in their college careers, spending less time in collegiate basketball, and transitioning to professional play sooner.

### **First Round Picks**
* Surpassed Expecations
  *   ****Lebron James** (27.2 PPG, 7.34 APG, 7.54 RPG):** Probably the most successful first round pick in the history of the NBA. Was the most hyped NBA prospect and not only did he live up to expecations he surpassed them
  *   ****Kyrie Irving** (23.78 PPG, 5.73 APG, 4.06 RPG):** Kyrie’s scoring average places him among the better offensive players. He also contributes well in terms of playmaking.
  *   ****Shaquille O'Neal** (21.88 PPG, 2.42 APG, 10.01 RPG):** The most dominant centre of all time.
  *   ****Tim Duncan** (18.89 PPG, 3.01 APG, 10.77 RPG): **Tim Duncan’s double-double average in points and rebounds shows he lived up to expectations, consistently contributing to both scoring and rebounding.
  *   ****Anthony Davis** (23.82 PPG, 10.29 RPG):** With his impressive scoring and rebounding averages, Davis has performed as expected for a first-round pick.
 
* Met Expecations
    * **Chris Webber (19.55 PPG, 9.46 RPG)**: Was a 5 time NBA All-Star and was also selected to 5 All NBA teams
    * **Karl-Anthony Towns (23.23 PPG, 10.85 RPG)** : Great stats and perhaps one of the best big man 3 point shooters.
 
* Busts
    * **Anthony Bennett (3.98 PPG, 0.40 APG, 2.85 RPG)**:  Considered the worst number 1 pick in NBA history. Bennet only played 4 seaons in the NBA
    * **Kwame Brown (6.17 PPG, 0.88 APG, 5.32 RPG):** Spent 12 years in the NBA, however never came close to the expecations of being a number 1 pick
 
### **Teams With the most Lottery Picks**
First-round picks are selections made by teams during the first round of the NBA Draft, where each team selects players who they believe have the potential to positively impact their team's performance. Being drafted in the first round typically indicates a high level of talent, as these picks are considered among the most promising prospects.
