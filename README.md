# NBA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

## **Overview**
This project provides an in-depth analysis of NBA player and team trends over time, using data visualization techniques to explore various aspects of the league. As a fan of the NBA for a few years now, I aimed to uncover patterns, shifts, and insights, both from a general perspective of the NBA and focusing on specific trends of interest, such as changes in player demographics, physical attributes, and team performance metrics.

The main questions I intended to explore include:

* How has the percentage of U.S. vs. non-U.S. players changed over time?
* What trends can be observed in player height, age, and weight across different NBA eras?
* What key performance metrics stand out for the Dallas Mavericks?
* Which players can be classified as "draft busts," and what are the key factors involved?
* Which colleges have produced the most NBA players?
* Which teams have had the most first-round picks, and what impact has this had on their performance?

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project was found on Kaggle and contains detailed information about players, teams, drafts, and career statistics

## **Main Findings**

### **Origin, Height, Age**
* **Player Nationality:** The majority of NBA players continue to be from the United States, highlighting the league's strong domestic talent pool, although there is a notable increase in international players over recent years.
* **Height Trends:** There has been a gradual decrease in average player height over the years. This trend correlates with the increasing prevalence of small-ball lineups, which prioritize speed and agility, allowing teams to better utilize the three-point line and adapt to modern playing styles.
* **Age Trends:** The average age of players in the league has steadily decreased. This shift is largely attributed to more athletes opting to enter the NBA directly from high school or early in their college careers, spending less time in collegiate basketball, and transitioning to professional play sooner.
